# snankeASM
Heres a basic snake game with 16 bit assembly. On Dos operation system. mainly for fun and for study. 
The game works. a few changes are needed though. If the snake's body on the apple it erase it. 
It could be handled with adding the color for the queue of pixles.  
Unfortunately, I dont have the time for those changes (considare the fact that it was merely self learning side project of mine, on my free time while Im a student).
This project had very usefull for me to practice my assembly skill's , my development and maintenance of large program ' s skills(well doucomented as well), 
and to better understand the basic foundations of OS. 
I belive that my project is highly readable for anyone who takes interst on assembly program.
